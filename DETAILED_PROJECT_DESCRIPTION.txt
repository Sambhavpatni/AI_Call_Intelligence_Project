PROJECT OVERVIEW – AI Call Intelligence System

This project demonstrates how modern AI systems can analyze and understand human conversations.

The platform allows users to upload a recorded sales or support call. The system automatically converts speech into text using Whisper, processes the transcript, and stores it in a vector database. Users can then ask natural language questions about the call, such as customer problems, objections, summaries, or action items.

The project focuses on:
• Practical use of Speech-to-Text
• Building a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline
• Designing AI-powered backend APIs
• Full-stack system integration
• Real-world AI engineering workflows
